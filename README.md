# Dungeon of Stone

## What is Dungeon of Stone?

<p> Dungeon of Stone is an independent project, a simple 2D action platformer, made by us two friends. It was created as a way to test our capabilities, to learn the workings of a game engine, and to create something that at the end of the day both me and my colleague can call good and say that we liked doing. </p>

There are two ways to play this game: <br>

## The Story and what was learned

<p>
  All in all, this project was made mostly for ourselves. To remind us what we aspire to, and that learning is only as useful as you want it to be. In this project I learned about Godot as an engine, and about GDScript. About how to look for information, since every single issue was resolved by knowing where to look. From the manual, to the forums, to videos.
